# RICH TALES

## About
A fully interactive multi-page website for a premium watch store. It features complete support for a shopping cart, wishlist, filters, and a watch search functionality. Additionally, in the non-GitHub Pages version, there is a dedicated product page. The website comprises 6 pages:

* Home;
* About;
* Contacts;
* Favorites;
* Cart;
* Catalogue;
* Product page (not on Github pages)

## Powered by
The website is built using NEXT.js with the aid of CSS modules. SwiperJS is employed for carousels. Redux is utilized for global state management for the shopping cart and favorites functionality.

## Bug
As GitHub Pages supports only static HTML pages, individual product pages that are dynamically rendered will not function on the site. On GitHub Pages, I've disabled the link to the separate product page. However, you can examine the code for this page in the [parentId] folder
